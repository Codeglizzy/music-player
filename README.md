# Music Player

This is a simple music player put together to allow me to quickly access my library of music. 

# How it Works

Simple, open the solution in Visual Studio C# Forms and compile the solution. I will be adding an executable to allow for easier use the in the future.

After compiling the program you should see this screen:

From here you need to click "Browse Directory" and navigate to the directory where you keep your music library. The name of the file will appear in the upper-right List Box, and the location of the file is stored accordingly in the lower-right List Box.

Here is what it will look like with music filled:

That is all for the hard stuff. 

From here on out, the program is fairly intuitive. 

* The slider is the volume bar.
* The blue text box displays the selected song name.
* "Browse Directory" Displays the Folder Browser Dialog so you can easily navigate to your music.
* "Play Song" Plays the selected song.
* "Stop" Will stop the song currently playing.

### That's the Magic!

Let me know if you run into any issues not listed below!
